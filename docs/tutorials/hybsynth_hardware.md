# Hardware needed for the project

#### 1. Raspberry Pi Development Board (Version 3, 4 or 5):

It is the main processing unit on which the whole project depends.

#### 2. One 5V DC power supply (with at least 3A of current)

The main power supply of the Raspberry Pi board and the HybSynth synthesizer.

#### 3. Breadboard

For prototyping & diagnosing the project before soldering the components on a PCB.

#### 4. Loudspeaker (with AUX connection)

As the main output of the synthesizer

#### 5. AUX cable

For connecting the loudspeaker to the Raspberry Pi board

#### 5. LED Module

A LCD module of any size with HDMI connection for displaying the values of the modules in real-time.
